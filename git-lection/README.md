# Git lection

## Rules:

1. For each step, you have a task.
2. When you finish it, you will have another task.
3. Repeat until no tasks are left.

## Task 1

### Situation

You have some code in your testing branch and want to apply it to your currect branch. But you want only some part of the code, only specific commits.

### Info

In this task you'll learn the [`git cherry-pick`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) command.

> Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits.

In other words, copy some commit to your current branch.

### Task

Apply the last 4 commits of the `fix/memory-leak` branch.
