## Task 5

### Info

[`git stash`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)

> Stash the changes in a dirty working directory away.

It's a great comment to "undo" the last commit. It can be often used with the `git rebase` to split the commit into a few.

### Task

1. Change this file a little bit.
2. Switch to the `fix/memoty-leak` branch and refactor the code.
3. Switch back and apply stashed changes, finish the task.

### **Change me**

Task status: `TODO`.

### What's next?
