It's a great comment to "undo" the last commit. It can be often used with the `git rebase` to split the commit into a few.

### Task

Observe current commits. Split the `feat(git): tbt-app: implement strings conversion;` commit into two:

* The first commit adds a new function.
* The second commit introduces the usage of this function.

### What's next?

Please, apply the next commit in this branch to get a new task.
